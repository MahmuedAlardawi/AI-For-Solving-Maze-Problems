# AI Project: Solving Maze Problems

## Introduction
This project tackles the challenge of solving maze problems using Artificial Intelligence. Utilizing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms, this project aims to find optimal paths in randomly generated mazes. The project is implemented in Java and features a graphical user interface (GUI) to visualize the maze and the pathfinding process.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Implements both DFS and BFS algorithms to solve the maze, demonstrating their effectiveness and efficiency in pathfinding.
- **Maze Representation**: Uses an adjacency matrix to represent the maze structure, allowing for efficient traversal and manipulation.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Visualizes the maze with different colors to represent statesâ€”green for the starting point, red for the goal, white for unmarked states, and black for walls.
- **Environment Analysis**: Operates in a partially observable, stochastic, static, discrete, and sequential environment, reflecting complex real-world scenarios.

## Technical Requirements

- **Java Development**: The entire project is developed in Java, requiring a Java development environment for execution.
- **GUI Development**: Utilizes Java Swing for the GUI components to display the maze and the paths found by the agents.
- **Performance Metrics**: Measures the efficiency of the algorithms based on the length of the path found and the time taken to find it.

## Objective

To apply AI techniques in solving complex problems like mazes, demonstrating the use of DFS and BFS algorithms in a controlled environment. This project enhances understanding of AI's applications in pathfinding scenarios and provides a foundation for further exploration into more advanced algorithms and AI strategies.

## How to Use

1. **Start the Application**: Run the Java application to initiate the GUI.
2. **Generate a Maze**: Use the GUI to generate a new maze or load a predefined one.
3. **Solve the Maze**: Choose between DFS or BFS to solve the maze.
4. **View the Solution**: Observe the pathfinding process in real-time on the GUI, where the path from the start to the goal will be marked in green.
5. **Analyze Results**: Review the performance metrics displayed, comparing the effectiveness of DFS and BFS in different maze configurations.
